Background for Cool Darkness

Sinclair was one of the first people to develop electromagnetic devices and weapons.  He created the first series of needlers and gaussian weaponry and has been creating state-of-the-art weaponry ever since.  The Sinclair K2 is a single hand-held needler that is not-so common among well armed groups or people of the lower class.  It uses longer needles than the K1, a single-hand needler that uses 3" needles, 80 per four inch mag.  These needles are 5" long with a 5" magholding 50. It's wider than a K1 and is used primarily for penetration and power against armored individuals.  Most K2's are semiauto while the K1 has on-the-fly switching from semi to full auto capabilities.  Cerated, armor piercing and explosive needles are available into the military, security and black markets.

Polymetals are alloys of metals that have polymer composites fabricated into the material at the time of final molding.  This allows for improved chemical and physical properties of the material while improving its strength and the ability to keep a sharp edge.  It also aids in reinforcing materials such as strengthening armor plating and bullet-proof jackets.

The story takes place somewhere around 2030 in a fast growing suburb of Philadelphia.
